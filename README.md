## BrighterPath

--------

## Full Stack React/Django App Details 
"BrighterPath" is a mock Non-Profit Agency web application. This web app is focused towards services for special needs children and their parents. 

    The front-end of the app will be mainly informative giving information on programs and services provided by the agency. The ultimate goal of the front end developement is to integrate unsplash api for all images rendered. I would like to have an area for prospective job seekers to view job postings, powered by the "Remotive API". Lastly, I would like to develop at contact form for any visitor to ask a question to the team and recieve messages to the company email.

    The back-end of the app will be CRUD centric. I want the back end to be a portal for parents of children utilizing brighterpath services. Parents should be able to upload and edit documents in the portal. Parents should also be able to delete specific documents. The back-end should function as a simple and small electronic health record system.


--------

## Front-End User Stories
